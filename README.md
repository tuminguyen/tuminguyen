# Hi and welcome to my github page.

I’m @tuminguyen, currently a master's student in Computer Science at University of Oulu.

- 👀 I’m interested in IoT, Machine/Robot Vision, VR/AR applications. In particular, I love to experience in 3D vision, scene reconstruction and autopilot in self-driving car. I have done some research using facial or UAV/drone's images.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a chance to collaborate/work on an IoT or 3D projects to expand my knowledge on what I haven't experienced before.  
- 📫 Since you are warmly welcomed for a technical talk and discussion, please reach me at: **hunguyen20@student.oulu.fi**
